/* 
  Force all direct child elements of the <form> to take full width.

  Why:
  - Some Angular Material components (like mat-form-field) or custom inputs
    don’t naturally expand to fill their grid cell — they size themselves
    based on their internal content.
  - This rule ensures consistency: every input, button, or custom component
    inside the form stretches to 100% of its grid column width.

  Scope:
  - The `> *` selector applies only to direct children of <form>, 
    so nested elements aren’t affected.
  - It helps prevent layout issues when using grid or flex layouts.
